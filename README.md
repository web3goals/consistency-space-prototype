## ‚ú® Description

It's an app where you can check in your activity like on GitHub, follow your friends, and motivate each other with your ability to be consistent in reaching your goals.

It's an app where influencers can show their real consistency, not just talk about it. And building their own onchain reputation that way.

And it's a perfect app for fans of tracking and decentralized data.

## ‚öíÔ∏è How it's made

To build this project, I used:

- Zora and Mode networks for storing smart contracts that allow people to create and manage their activities in the form of tokens.

- And Ethereum Attestation Service to store activity check-ins made by users.

## üîÆ What's next

It would be great to:

- Add gasless transactions.

- Add login via web2 social networks.

- Improve UI for mobile users.

- Integrate oracles to verify off-chain activities.
